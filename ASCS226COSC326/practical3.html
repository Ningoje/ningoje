<p>Searle's argument first appared in his paper "Minds ,Brains ,and Programs",published in <b><i>Behavioral and Brains Sciences</i></b> in 1980. It has been widely discussed in the years since. If you can carry on an intelligent conversation  with an unknown patner does this imply your statements are understood?<p>
<hr />
 Searles also describes the following positions to advocates of strong Al: 
 <ul>
 
 <li>AI systems can be used to explain the mind:</li>
 <li>The study of the brain is irrelevant to the study of the brain of the mind ; and</li>
 <li>The turing test is adequate for establishing the existence of mental states</li>

 </ul>
 
 <b><u>Each of the following, according to Harnad, is a "tenet" of the computationalism: </u></b>
 <ol>
 <li> Mentak states are computational states (which is why computers can have mentak states and help to explain the mind);</li>
 <li> Computational states are implementation-independent-- in other words, it is the software that determines the computational state, not the hardware(which is why the brain ,being hardware, irrelevant);and that </li>
 <li> Since implementing is unimportant,the only empirical data that matters is how the system funtions ;hence the Turing test is definitive.</li>
